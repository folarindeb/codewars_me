2- Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight. Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds. Example: h = 0, m = 1, s = 1, result = 61000, Input constraints: 0 <= h <= 23, 0 <= m <= 59, 0 <= s <= 59

3 - We need a function that can transform a number into a string. What ways of achieving this do you know?

4- Bob needs a fast way to calculate the volume of a cuboid with three values: length, width and the height of the cuboid. Write a function to help Bob with this calculation.
